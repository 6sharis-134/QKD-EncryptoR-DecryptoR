# QKD-EncryptoR-DecryptoR
This project focuses on using Quantum Key Distribution to encrypt or decrypt a message between two quantum channels.

Abstract.
In this project we have used the Quantum Key Distribution(QKD) to encrypt and decrypt
the message between the communication channel. We have utilized the Cirq library
developed by Google to create the Quantum Key for the secure communication and
cryptography of our message\information. We have developed mainly four function
which will carry out the deed in securing the message through the channel namely:
(i)Quantum_Key() 
(ii)Measure_Quantum_Key 
(iii)EncryptoR() 
(iv)DecryptoR()
